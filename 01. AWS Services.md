Compute Services on AWS
=======================

* EC2
  * Provides secure and resizable virtual servers on AWS
* AWS Elastic Beanstalk
  * Platform for scaling and deploying web apps and services
* AWS Lambda
  * Enables compute without manging servers

### EC2 Use Cases

* Web application hosting
* Batch processing
* Web services endpoint
* Desktop in the cloud (Windows \> Remote Desktop)

### EC2 Concepts

* Instance Types
  * Define the processor, memory, and storage type
  * Cannot be changed without downtime
  * Provided in the categories
    * General purpose
    * Compute, memory, and storage optimized
    * Accelerated computing (for ML)
  * Pricing is baed on instance type
  * Some instance types have unique price type
* Root Device Type
  * Instance Store (data will go away after shutdown)
  * Elastic Block Store (EBS) - Persistent storage
* Amazon Machine Image (AMI)
  * Template for an EC2
  * AWS provides many templates
  * Can be shared across AWS accounts
* Purchase Options
  * On-Demand
  * Reserved
  * Saving Plan
  * Spot
  * Dedicated

```typescript
#!/bin/bash
yum install httpd -y
service httpd start
```

Networkign & CDN
================

* Amazon Route 53
* Amazon VPC
* AWS Direct Connect
* Amazon API Gateway
* Amazon CloudFront
* Elastic Load Balancing

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)
----------------------------------

A logically isolated section of the AWS Cloud where you can launch AWS resources in a virtual network that you define.

* Enables virtual networks in AWS
* Suports IPv4 and IPv6
* Allows for configuration of
  * IP address range
  * Subnets
  * Route tables
  * Network gateways
* Supports public and private subnets
* Can utilize NAT for private subnets
* Enables a connection to your data center
* Can connect to other VPC’s
* Supports private connections to many AWS services

AWS Direct Connect
------------------

A cloud service solution that makes it easy to establish a dedicated network connection from your data centre to AWS.

Amazon Route 53
---------------

* Domain name service (DNS)
  * DNS changes are not instantaneous, It does need to what we call propagate those changes throughout the network of DNS servers around the world. Might take a couple of hours for some of your changes.
* Global AWS service (not regional)
* Highly available
* Enable global resource routing (redirecting user based on their country)

**Let’s say we have a e-commere website in one region, what if the server goes down in region A?**

We can configure Route 53 to have failover so that if it can’t reach its primary server, it can then route users to a new server. Users don’t have to know that anything has changed.

Elastic Load Balancing
----------------------

The ability for infrastructure supporting an application to grow and contract based on how much it is used at a point in time; **How we actually route users to the correct infrastructure.**

* Distrubutes traffic accross multipe tragets
* Integrates with EC2, ECS, and Lamda
* Supports one or more AZ’s in a region
* Three types of load balancers:
  * Application Load Balancer (ALB)
  * Network Load Balancer (NLB)
  * Classic Load Balancer

### Scaling on Amazon EC2

* Vertical Scaling
  * You "scale up" your instance type to a larger instance type with additional resources (no a best way tho)
* Horizontal Scaling
  * You “scale out” and add additional instances to handle the demand of your application (the best way)

Amazon CloudFront and API Gateway
---------------------------------

### Amazon CloudFront

* Content delivery network (CDN)
* Enables users to get content from server closest to them
* Supports static and dynamic content
* Utilizes AWS edge locations
* Includes advanced security features
  * AWS Shield for DDoS
  * AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall)

### API Gateway

* Fully managed API management service (for creating web services)
* Directly integrates with multiple AWS services
* Provides monitoring & metrics on API calls
* Suuports VPC and on-permise private applications

AWS Global Accelerator
----------------------

It’s a networking service that sends your user’s traffic through Amazon Web Service’s global network infrastructure, improving your internet user performance by up to 60%.

* Utilizes IP address that route to edge locations
* Once request reaches edge locations, traffic is routed through AWS network
* Can route requests to many AWS resources
  * Network Load Balancer (NLB)
  * Application Load Balancer (ALB)
  * EC2 Instances
  * Elastic IP address
* Use Cases
  * Non-HTTP Protocol
    * UDP
    * MQTT
    * VOIP
  * Requires Static IP
  * Instant Failover

File Storage Services
=====================

* Amazon S3
  * Store files as objects in buckets
  * Provides different storage classes for different use cases
  * Stores data across multiple availablty zones
  * Enables URL access for files
  * Offers configurable rules for data lifecycle
  * Can serve as a static website host
* Amazon S3 Glacier
  * For archiving data within S3 as separate storage classes
  * Offers configurable retrieval time
  * Can send files directly or through lifecycle rules in S3
  * Provides two different storage classes
    * S3 Glacier
    * S3 Glacier Deep Archive
* Amazon Elastic Block Store
* Amazon Elastic File System
* AWS Snowball
* AWS Snowmobile

AWS Databases & Related Services
================================

* Amazon RDS
  * It’s a Platform As a Service
  * Fully maaged service for relational databases
  * Handles provisioning, patching, backup, and recovery of our database
  * Supports deployment across multiple availability zones (multi-AZ)
  * Some platforms support read replicas
  * Launches into a VPC
